            The <strong>B</strong>uddhist <strong>C</strong>ommunity <strong>A</strong>t <strong>S</strong>tanford was
            founded to support members of the Stanford community who are interested in learning about Buddhism and
            deepening their engagement with Buddhist practices. It provides a space for everyone, regardless of
            religious affiliation and prior experience or knowledge, to engage with and learn more about what the many
            Buddhist traditions have to offer, and to develop spiritually nourishing friendships. BCAS is committed to
            ceasing prejudice and injustice in our wider communities, and strives to put Buddhist principles of
            compassion and wisdom into practice in both our own programming and beyond.
        </p>

            BCAS is not affiliated with any particular lineage or school of Buddhism and welcomes all students, staff,
            faculty and friends who are interested in or just curious about any aspect of Buddhism. All our events are
            open to everyone, and require no prior meditation experience or knowledge of Buddhism.
