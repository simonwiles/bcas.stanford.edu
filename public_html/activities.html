      We currently hold group meditation sessions on Monday mornings from 8-9am, and Thursday afternoons from
      1:30-2:30pm. The sessions will feature sitting, walking, and movement meditations, depending on who is
      facilitating and what the interests of the group are. All meditation sessions are held in the <a

        title="CIRCLE Sanctuary">CIRCLE Sanctuary</a> on the 3rd floor of Old Union. These sessions are held while class
      is in session but not during summer, Thanksgiving, winter and spring breaks. You can always use our calendar on
      the <a href="/program.html">program page</a> to see if we are holding the session or not.

      Occasionally, we have other one-time events such as inviting Buddhist teachers from various traditions to visit us
      and offer meditation instruction and Dharma talks or holding meditation retreats at monasteries in the area. When
      they occur, these events will be posted on the program page.

      Events, including study groups, film screenings, visits to local Buddhist centers and short retreats are arranged
      according to interest. Please let us know if there is an event you would like to see.
