      <p>At this time, we hold group meditation sessions on Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 8:30 and 9:00am. The sessions have varying levels of guidance depending on who is facilitating. On Sunday there is group meditation and discussion between 10 and 11am. All these sessions are held in the CIRCLE Sanctuary on the 3rd floor of Old Union. These sessions are held while class is in session and during finals week but not during summer, Thanksgiving, winter and spring breaks. You can always use our calendar on the <a href="/program.html">program page</a> to see if we are holding the session or not.</p>
      <p>We hold a community meeting about once a month during the school year. Subscribe to our mailing list to be notified when they are organized.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, we have other one-time events such as inviting Buddhist teachers from various traditions to visit us and offer meditation instruction and Dharma talks or holding meditation retreats at monasteries in the area. When they occur, these events will be posted on the program page.</p>
      <p>Events, including study groups, film screenings, visits to local Buddhist centers and short retreats are arranged according to interest. Please let us know if there is an event you would like to see.</p>
